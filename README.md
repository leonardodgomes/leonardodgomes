## 🚀 About Me
I’m Leonardo — a data engineer who loves building scalable systems and explaining them in a way that makes sense to everyone in the room.

My career blends two worlds:

- **Engineering** → designing reliable, optimized data pipelines

- **Sales Engineering** → translating technical solutions into business value
  
I’m currently focused on:
- Databricks & Lakehouse Architecture
- PySpark & Delta Lake engineering patterns
- Power BI analytics & semantic modeling
- Technical storytelling for customer-facing roles

This GitHub is my **central hub**: a place where I learn, build, document, and share everything that shapes my journey.
